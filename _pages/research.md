### Dissertation project: _Voting for nostalgia?: Authoritarian legacies and voting behavior in post-authoritarian democracies._


### Work in progress

**"Authoritarian Legacy Parties and Corruption Voting"**

Existing literature shows that partisanship leads voters to overlook poor performance. This paper argues that this bias is particularly pronounced among supporters of authoritarian legacy parties. Building on studies of motivated reasoning and asymmetric partisan bias, I highlight the importance of partisan differences in how voters interpret corruption charges and make voting decisions. I argue that in post-authoritarian democracies, supporters of authoritarian legacy parties are less likely to punish corrupt copartisan incumbents compared to supporters of other parties faced with equally corrupt copartisan incumbents. While voters of all kinds appear likely to ignore corruption among copartisan incumbents, supporters of authoritarian legacy parties are particularly likely to do so. Stronger partisan attachments to authoritarian legacy parties encourages voters to trade off punishment for corruption with core values like economic prosperity, social stability, and national security, which the parties inherited from an authoritarian past. Voters, motivated by authoritarian nostalgia, disregard corruption information and fail to employ performance-based criteria when assessing copartisan politicians. Empirical results with election data and survey data from South Korea and Taiwan illustrate partisan discrepancies and a striking lack of performance-based voting among authoritarian legacy partisans.
