I am a PhD candidate at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I received my BA in Political Science and Economics and an MA in Political Science from Korea University. I began my PhD program at the University of Illinois in 2016. My research interest focuses on legacy parties in new democracies and their effects on voting behavior.
